All components in here were generated by w3 schools. (https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/default.asp) 
The main reason for making this was keeping tabs and little notes for myself about the cpp language.
Remember that you must include the "using namespace std" at the top of your code if you don't feel like typing std:: every single time for cin and cout.
Usually, I will use std:: to be oldschool and the fact that I may not remember the syntax for using the standard namespace library.
Furthermore, cin uses >>. Imagine the aligator thingies are pointed toward whichever variable you want. Ex: std::cin >> x; Which calls for user input and stores it as x.
cout is <<. I don't know how to expand on this. It is simply just <<.
Anyway, hopefully I maintain this page and this doesn't just go to electric limbo...
